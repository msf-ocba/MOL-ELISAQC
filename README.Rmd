## Overview:

This R Shiny application is part of the tool-kit developed for the [Mobile Outbreak Laboratory (MOL)](https://msf-transformation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mobile-Lab-Project-Summary-2019.06.13.pdf) transformative investment capacity (TIC) project. 

The primary objective is to automate processing and quality control of raw results for [EUROIMMUN antibody detection enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) kits](https://www.euroimmun.com/products/infection-diagnostics/id/vaccine-preventable-diseases/) frequently used in the diagnosis of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.  The application takes data generated by the Biotek 800 TS [Gen5 software](https://www.biotek.com/products/software-robotics-software/gen5-microplate-reader-and-imager-software/) (version 3.08.01).  Results are calculated and interpreted according to EUROIMMUN kit instructions and standards.  External control samples are also evaluated with Levey-Jennings charts.  Processed results, including quality control flags and sample ID labels, are made available to download as a .csv file which can then be imported or incorporated into a patient database. A summary of the quality control assessment for each plate is provided as a downloadable HTML report. 

**Note:**

This application has been designed to be as user-friendly as possible.  The intended audience are laboratory technicians with no R or programming experience, who may also have limited prior experience with EUROIMMUN kits.  For this reason, some attributes (such as what cells to find the raw data in in Gen5 output) are hard-coded into the app. In future versions, these attributes may be made editable for advanced users.  The structure of the input data will be prioritised for increased user input as this would allow acceptance of input data from other microplate readers or from future versions of Gen5 software.     


## Details:

`ELISAQC` has been developed as a stand-alone Shiny App, which can be launched off-line via a .bat file on the desktop (included in this repository).  Note that the file path in the .bat file needs to be amended to where the user has installed this repository.


### User inputs:

1. Position of calibrators, controls and sample IDs (via an interactive ELISA plate template)
2. Raw optical densities (browser and up-loader for Gen5 output file in .csv format)
3. EUROIMMUN kit batch reference values and ranges (via interactive dialogue box)
4. EUROIMMUN kit ranges for interpretation of calculated results
5. Optional in-house positive control acceptable range (as values or data upload)

This user-provided data (inputs 3 to 5) can optionally be saved as a configuration file, which can then be uploaded and re-used for subsequent runs with the same parameters.


### Data processing:

`ELISAQC` performs the following steps to process and interpret the data:

 - Labels raw results with sample IDs as provided by the user in the first input step
 - Converts data from wide to long format ("tidy" data) for further processing
 - Calculates the sample:calibrator ratio for positive and negative controls and patient samples
 - Interprets the results for controls and patient samples as negative, indeterminate, or positive
 - Determines if positive and negative controls are within the kit reference range and applies a pass/fail flag
 - Determines if in-house positive controls are within range and applies a pass/fail flag (if provided) 
 - Determines the coefficient of variation for control well duplicates and applies a pass/fail flag
 - Combines the three quality control flags to indicate if the run has passed overall or not


### Outputs:

`ELISAQC` provides the following outputs for the user:

 - Quality control report, containing:
    + Summary table of quality control results
    + Levey-Jennings graph of in-house positive control value from the current run compared to the reference range
    + Levey-Jenning graph of in-house negative control value from the current run compared to the reference range
    + Heatmap of calculated results in plate layout with labels
    + Summary statement indicating if the run has passed the quality control criteria or not
 - Processed ELISA results for patient samples labelled with patient IDs (as .csv to download)
 - downloadable .csv configuration file (which can be edited and re-used for future runs)

Some example output is shown below:

**A. Summary table of internal quality control assessment:**

**B. Graph comparing in-house negative control with reference values:**

**C. Graph comparing in-house positive control with reference values:**

**D. Heatmap of ELISA plate (calibration-normalised ratios):**

**E. Summary statement for QC report:**

If the run has failed the quality control evaluation, an informative message advising on possible causes of the failure is printed, as follows:

```{r echo=FALSE}

cat("Ce test ELISA a échoué aux procédures internes de contrôle de la qualité.\nEnvisagez de refaire le test de la plaque.\nLes problèmes suivants doivent être vérifiés et résolus lors du dépannage:\n
A. Si les résultats sont trop faibles:\n- Le temps d'incubation était trop court\n- La température d'incubation était trop basse\n- Le tampon de lavage n'a pas été complètement retiré des puits\n- Il y a eu une rupture de la chaîne du froid pendant le stockage des réactifs\n
B. Si les résultats sont trop élevés:\n- Le temps d'incubation était trop long\n- La température d'incubation (ambiante) était trop élevée\n- Le lavage des assiettes était insuffisant (temps trop court ou pas assez de tampon de lavage utilisé)\n- Une contamination croisée s'est produite (si les valeurs du contrôle négatif sont trop élevées)\n 
C. Si les Coefficients de variation (CV) sont trop élevés:\n- Les broches du lecteur ELISA peuvent etre mal alignées\n- Les composants optiques du lecteur ELISA peuvent être contaminés par de la poussière")

```



It is assumed that under normal circumstances, users will run alignment calibration checks on the ELISA reader prior to running a plate and not proceed if these checks fail.  In the event that equipment is being tested in operational conditions, however, high coefficients of well-to-well variation between duplicate samples can be a useful indicator of the extent of impact of any alignment problems. 


## Package dependencies:

The following R packages are used for the `ELISAQC` shiny app:

 - `shiny`
 - `knitr`
 - `rmarkdown`
 - `rhandsontable`
 - `here`
 - `data.table`
 - `dplyr`
 - `tidyr`
 - `ggplot2`
 - `flextable`
 - `officer`
 - `openxlsx`

This list will be updated when initial development of the app is complete.  The release version will be bundled with required packages.
